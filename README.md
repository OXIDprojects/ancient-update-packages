# Ancient OXID eShop cumulative update packages AKA CUPs

This repository contains the ancient cumulative update packages for OXID eShop Community Edition up to the latest version before OXID6, v4.10.8.

The updates sometimes have to be done step by step. If your run a version between the marked update packages, it is safe to overwrite the entire files with the cumulative update package.

Example: You run OXID eShop v4.8.5 and want to update to 4.10.8 first (before switching over to OXID6, which is highly recommended), just download the entire package UPDATE_OXID_ESHOP_CE_V.4.8.0_TO_V.4.10.8.zip, unpack it and follow the update routine. It is safe to overwrite all the files.
